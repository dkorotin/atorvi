# atorvi - ATomic ORbitals VIsualization

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)

**atorvi** is a Python package for visualizing individual atomic orbitals and their various linear combinations. The library generates requested atomic orbitals on a 3D mesh and exports them, along with the inputted crystal structure (molecule or periodic crystal), into a file in [XCrysDen .xsf format](http://www.xcrysden.org/doc/XSF.html).

The resulting `.xsf` file can be opened and visualized using your favorite visualization software, such as [XCrysDen](http://www.xcrysden.org/), [VESTA](https://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/) or [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/).

## Installation

To install **atorvi**, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install atorvi
```

## Features

- **Atomic Orbitals Generation**: Create atomic orbitals at a specific position in space or at a designated atom/element within a crystal structure. 

- **Flexible Structure Input**: Input crystal structures either manually, atom-by-atom, or directly from standard file formats such as POSCAR, XSF, CIF, and more. The integration with the `pymatgen` package simplifies structure handling.

- **Orbital Hybridization**: Implement orbital hybridization by mixing different orbitals with custom coefficients, allowing for the exploration of complex bonding interactions.

- **Orbital Squared Moduli**: Generate squared moduli of orbitals, providing insight into their spatial distribution and probability densities.

Examples of orbitals generated with **atorvi**: could be found in [examples](./examples/) folder.

## Quick start

The full user manual is available in [docs/atorvi_manual.md](./docs/atorvi_manual.md).

**atorvi** can be used in two modes: package mode (for scripting and notebooks) and CLI interactive mode (only basic functionality is available).

### 1.Package Mode 
In your Python script or Jupyter notebook, you can generate and visualize atomic orbitals with the following example:

```python
import atorvi

# Example: visualize a d_{3z^2-r^2} orbital for an Ni atom (Z = 28)
outfile = atorvi.OrbitalFile("Ni_orbital.xsf")

outfile.add_orbital("d_{3z^2-r^2}", position=[0, 0, 0], znumber=28)

outfile.write_data()
```

Then just open the `Ni_orbital.xsf` file in your favorite visualization software.

The orbitals available for generation are:
```math
s, \\
p_z, p_x, p_y \\
d_{3z^2-r^2}, d_{xz}, d_{yz}, d_{xy}, d_{x^2-y^2} \\
f_{z^3}, f_{xz^2}, f_{yz^2}, f_{xyz}, f_{z(x^2-y^2)}, f_{x(x^2-3y^2)}, f_{y(3x^2-y^2)} 
```

```python
print(atorvi.supported_orbitals)

['s', 
'p_z', 'p_x', 'p_y', 
'd_{3z^2-r^2}', 'd_{xz}', 'd_{yz}', 'd_{xy}', 'd_{x^2-y^2}', 
'f_{z^3}', 'f_{xz^2}', 'f_{yz^2}', 'f_{xyz}', 'f_{z(x^2-y^2)}', 'f_{x(x^2-3y^2)}', 'f_{y(3x^2-y^2)}']
```

### 2. CLI Interactive Mode
atorvi also offers an interactive mode via the command line interface (CLI). You can simply run the script directly in a terminal:

```bash
atorvi_cli
```

Follow the prompts to generate orbitals and export them to XCrysDen-compatible formats.

Once the file is generated, you can open it using visualization tools like XCrysDen or VESTA.
